# Photo Carousel Replica
### A Frontend implementation of Carousel

----------

##### The app runs without any server and photos will not be saved.

* How to run?
* A valid internet connection is required (as angular is fetched from a CDN).
* Clone the project and open index.html in any web browser.
* Add photos as required and by clicking next/prev the photos carousel can be viewed.

This is just a basic implementation of Carousel.

#### Scope for Enhancements

* Animation can be implemented.
* A Server to remember the state of the application.
* Saving the photos in any photo sharing application (by using their APIs).
* Responsive UI (currently it is semi responsive).
* CREATE AND UPDATE Operations to implement any filters or changing the out text after saving the photo.
* Social Network Sharing capability.
